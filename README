The GNOME Gmail Notifier is a project designed to provide a simple, easy-
to-use application that monitors users' gmail inbox(es), and to deliver
the appropriate notifications when new mail exists.

In order to use the GNOME Gmail Notifier, you'll need the following
prerequesite packages, whether compiled from source or not:

  * GLib 2.6.0
  * GTK+ 2.12.0
  * GConf 2.20.0
  * Libxml2 2.6.20
  * Libsoup 2.6.0
  * Libnotify 0.4.2
  * GStreamer 0.10.0
  * Gnome Keyring 0.4.2

When compiling from subversion, please use './autogen.sh --prefix=/usr',
'make', and 'sudo make install' to install from source. Users installing
from source tarballs may replace the 'autogen.sh' with 'configure' in the
above commands to perform the same tasks.

This project codebase has sustained three successive rewrites, and each
has introduced numerous, massive improvements into the project. The
current codebase is written using GLib and GObject, and utilizes the
GLib multithreading capability to monitor multiple user accounts. Recent
improvements have yielded support for proxy-based connections and faster,
more reliable mail checking routines, as well as a more sturdy graphical
user interface. Finally, the last rewrite nailed down the complete 
internal functionality of the notifier in the most logical way possible,
ensuring that stability and ease of modification are the top priority.
In short, the project is quite mature.
