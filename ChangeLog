    * GgnPrefsWindow: implemented all functionality and rewrote
      libglade code into newer GtkBuilder code.
    * GgnManager: implemented complete functionality, including
      advanced new mail notifications, an extended left-click
      popup menu under conditions of >1 enabled account, and
      mailto commandline support.
    * configure.ac: updated version to 0.10.1 for next release.

Wed Dec 23 12:19 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * GgnAccount: created ggn-account.[ch] and ggn-account-priv.h
      for the newly designed account object. accounts are now the
      most important object in the notifier, directly managing
      underlying preferences when their data are changed and keeping
      detailed track of their entries arrays.
    * ggn-account.c: entries are now managed by their states in
      the inbox: NEW, UNREAD, or READ.
    * GgnAccountList: created ggn-account-list.[ch] and the
      ggn-account-list-priv.h for the account list object and
      implemented all functionality. the account list is now
      generated from the GgnPrefs object on startup, meaning
      accounts are built behind the scenes without GgnManager
      intervention.
    * GgnAudio: created ggn-audio.[ch] and ggn-audio-priv.h
      for audio playback functionality and implemented all
      required code.
    * GgnEntry: created ggn-entry.[ch] and ggn-entry-priv.h
      for keeping track of account entries and their data,
      implemented fully.
    * GgnManager: created ggn-manager.[ch] and ggn-manager-priv.h
      and added a few bits of functionality. the manager is to be
      trimmed of all excess fat: it is to hold only the backbone
      application code and notification logic.
    * GgnPrefsWindow: created ggn-prefs-window.[ch] and the
      associated ggn-prefs-window-priv.h for the preferences
      window. no functionality as of yet.

Mon Jun 22 21:21 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * GgnPrefs: created ggn-prefs.[ch] and ggn-prefs-priv.h
      for the newly designed and cleaned up preferences access
      object. a quick test says it works as expected.
    * GgnIcon: created ggn-icon.[ch] and ggn-icon-priv.h for
      the status icon and notification bubble functionality.
      a cursory examination and testing shows it to work.

Fri Jun 19 16:13 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * GgnKeyring: created ggn-keyring.[ch] and implemented the
      functionality required for keyring access. The topology
      of the functions involved did not warrant the creation
      of a distinct GObject subclass, but was important enough
      to be rewritten and set apart in the codebase.

Sun Jun 07 21:28 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * GgnXML: created ggn-xml.[ch] and ggn-xml-priv.h for the
      newly bugfixed, rewritten and renamed xml parser object.
    * GgnAboutDialog: create ggn-about-dialog.[ch] and
      ggn-about-dialog-priv.h for the newly bugfixed and
      rewritten about dialog object.

Sat Jun 06 18:48 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * configure.ac: fixed LIBS and CFLAGS defines to shrink
      the size of the compilation output by eliminating
      -library and -I/nclude clutter.
    * Makefile.am: same as for configure.ac.

Sun May 31 14:36 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-atom-feed.c: added extra checks to ensure that a
      minimum number of trys are made for each atom feed
      HTTP GET. (some HTTP 401's do not trigger the soup
      "authenticate" signal... ???)
    * ggn-preferences.c: optimized the account modification
      routine to only change settings fields which have been
      modified.
    * ggn-config.c: fixed account edit window to carry over
      enabled status of account during an edit process.

Sat May 30 15:21 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-preferences.c: complete and absolute overhaul of
      much of the API involved with preferences get/set, most
      of which is related to accounts management.

      aforementioned overhaul.
    * ggn-config.c: reworking of logic relating to the
      aforementioned overhaul.

      with an incorrect password in the SoupSessionSync
      "authenticate" signal.

    * ggn-atom-feed.c: small changes to coincide with api
      changes in other parts of the source, namely the change
      from *_username() to *_user().
    * ggn-config.c: fixes to accomodate api changes in the
      GgnPreferences source code.
    * ggn-manager.c: fixes to accomodate api changes in the
      GgnPreferences source code.
    * ggn-preferences.c: complete removal of the xml config
      file.
    * ggn-util.c: ggn_client_execute() exhibits safer gconf
      client reference count behavior now by unref()-ing the
      client it uses to get the browser/emailer commands.
    * ggn-edit.glade: added a domain name text entry for
      hosted gmail account users to enter their domain into.

Thu May 28 19:41 2009  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

      packages for automake, autoconf, etc... thanks to
      eric.n.brown for this fix.
    * configure.ac: added checks for required gstreamer
      plugins, so as not to upset the notifier while
      running. :-)

      callback to make the preferences window seem a bit more
      like a dialog.

Sat Dec 22 02:04 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * configure.ac: removed all requirements of gnutls/gcrypt

    * ggn-atom-feed.h: added some definitions for keyring
      password lookups.
    * ggn-preferences.c: removed all writing of passwords to
      the xml preferences file, and added routines for the
      use of gnome-keyring to load/store passwords.

Fri Dec 21 01:06 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-manager.c: changed 'react' behavior to only make

      for the extra legwork needed to initialize threading in
      gcrypt/gnutls.

      ggn_config_get_widget function, which should've been the
      glade_xml_get_widget function.

      when NLS is enabled.
    * ggn-presence.c: changed g_usleep invocation into a

      object, which will allow the GgnManager to track which
      feeds return HTTP errors (like unauthorized).
    * ggn-manager.c: added error count to the parameters sent
      to the ggn_manager_handle_inbox_change function, which
      can do with them what it wishes.

      that can occur during the check process, and perfected
      the reaction decision logic to a one-liner.
    * gnome-gmail-notifier: removed every trace of ggn_free_str
      from the program, as it was useless.
    * ggn-preferences.c: modified the behavior of the proxy
      property, so that the preferences object always pulled
      the proxy uri from the gnome settings via gconf.

Tue Jul 03 12:03 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-manager.c: forced gdk to flush the command buffer
      when inside the feed checking thread.
    * configure.ac: added code to generate the data/*.in
      files' counterparts using the autotools, instead of
      using my stupid custom script.
    * data/Makefile.am: removed invocation of my stupid

      to be selected will be "greyed out" when no account
      is selected.
    * ggn-manager.c: rewrote ggn_manager_update_array and
      hooked it into various other functions to ensure that
      the GUI would never lock, and that the accounts list
      always stayed synced with the feeds array.
    * ggn-atom-feed.c: fixed warning from libsoup about
      soup_uri_free trying to free a NULL SoupUri.
    * ggn-xml-parser.c: fixed the parser to recover on the
      "extra content at the end of document" error, which
      really shouldn't keep the parser from finishing.

Tue Jun 26 09:57 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-manager.c: fixed plural/singular message grammar
      in the notification summary.

      loop system, which does all of the notifications that
      the previous version did, just with a little more zing.

Mon Jun 25 15:15 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * data: created welcome.html and associated files, which
      help new users setup their notifiers on the first run.
    * ggn-presence.c: added support for the CHECKING style,
      which can be used during mail check cycles.

Sun Jun 24 12:59 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-about.glade.in: fixed the copyright symbol in the
      glade xml input file.
    * ggn-manager.c: fixed up ggn_manager_update_array and
      set the basic checking loop in place, but no actual
      feed refresh happens yet.
    * ggn-xml-parser.c: basically overhauled the load_string
      function on the grounds that it was crashing pretty
      regularly, and we came out with a shiny new xml
      parsing function.

    * ggn-presence.c: completed the rest of the notification,
      tray icon, and menu functionality, as well as a callback
      set for tray icon and menu actions. from the looks of
      the code now, it seems that the best approach to summing
      all of these objects is to create a GgnManager object
      which handles the rest of them.

Thu Jun 21 13:03 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * build files: added libglade support into configure.ac
      and src/Makefile.am to allow the application to use
      GladeXML objects.

      the various package managers.

Thu Jun 21 11:38 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

      and a tray icon.

Wed Jun 20 17:20 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-preferences.c: implemented safe get() functions for

    * ggn-preferences.c: created basic read() and write()
      functions to load and save the preferences file on
      the fly. all xml code is backwards compatible with
      old notifier versions, and the transition is 100%
      transparent to the user. still need to implement
      the myriad of get/set functions.

Wed Jun 20 11:40 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

      list of dependencies.

Tue Jun 19 17:53 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * ggn-xml-parser.c: implemented basic XML parsing set of
      functionality, which is similar to GMarkup, but with
      extra data, such as a non-conforming XPath system, a
      hash table for the XML tag attributes, and true GLib
      signals for the processing callback functions.
    * ggn-atom-feed.c: linked GgnAtomFeed into the created
      GgnXmlParser functionality, and everything is still
      working.

Mon Mar 05 16:31 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

      first error, not every retry.

Thu Feb 08 15:23 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

Tue Feb 06 22:22 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * application.c: general order of init now gives gtk and
      libnotify a chance to breath before checking the mail

      screen.

Tue Feb 06 11:24 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * xml-parser.c: added another specific error return for
      the sometimes-returned xml parse error.
    * application.c: improved reaction to nonfatal mail check
      errors in application_update, and checked for xml parse
      error. project seems to be bug-free.

Sat Jan 13 17:58 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * application.c: application_update checks for the "bad"
      utf8 error and re-runs the parse if that's the case.
    * application.c: application_update re-registers itself
      with updated interval values. kind of a hack, but at
      least with smaller values, the change is palatable.
    * gnome-gmail-notifier: version officially set to 0.5.3.

Sat Jan 13 15:50 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * notifier.c: added extra qualifier to ensure the icon

Sat Jan 13 13:42 2007  Bradley Worley  (geekysuavo@gmail.com)

    * feed-downloader.c: overhauled libcurl http get source
      with libsoup multithreaded code. libsoup returns true
      utf8, so there's no interface error with GMarkupParser.
    * gnome-gmail-notifier: pre-alpha is a wrap, or at least
      that's probably the case. version officially set to
      0.5.0.

    * tray-icon.c: added tooltips that update based on status.
    * gnome-gmail-notifier: all testbeds have been implemented
      and interlinked with each other by the application layer.
      if it weren't for the parse error created by the feed
      interpreter, i would call this project a wrap. dammit.
